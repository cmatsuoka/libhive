/*
 * h5_engines.c - per-voice DSP engines.
 *
 * Every tone generator follows one architecture: a tonal branch (a sine
 * oscillator with a drive blend into a triangle branch), a sustained
 * noise branch (filtered noise under its own AR envelope) and a short
 * transient burst on the filtered noise. All three branches sum into a
 * soft-clip shaper and leave through a fixed output filter.
 *
 *   - Tone path: the tone envelope is a linear AR whose value is cubed;
 *     the cube drives both the tone amplitude and the pitch exponent.
 *     The tone branch pairs a sine oscillator with the triangle of the
 *     same phase through the Drive blend: the triangle carries the odd
 *     harmonics that give the tone its body, the way the original
 *     device's triangle core does. The Kick tone attack is 0.005*Decay and
 *     the Drive blends the sine with the triangle branch, whose weight
 *     per engine differs; the triangle branch follows the body envelope
 *     so it decays with the sound.
 *   - Sustained noise: filtered noise * AR(noise_attack, Decay release) *
 *     noiseWeight.
 *   - Transient burst: AR^10 over the same filtered noise with a 1 ms
 *     attack, weighted Click^0.25.
 *   - Pitch envelope: f = Pitch * 1.5^(Bend*env^3/12) applies to the
 *     tonal branch of each voice.
 *   - Noise cutoff sweep: (NoisePitch + 2000*env_n^3)
 *     * (1 - FilterBend*(1 - env_n^3)); FilterBend 0.5 on the Kick and
 *     0.55/0.57/0.56 per Tom instance. The noise passes a fixed 50 Hz
 *     high-pass / 20 kHz low-pass band limit first.
 *   - Output: tanh(1.5 * mix) * 1.10 * output filter. The saturation
 *     sits inside the curve, so a mix below full scale is compressed
 *     smoothly and the shaper never clips; the engine emits Q30
 *     (1.0 = 1 << 30) with one headroom bit, and the mixer applies the
 *     user Volume exactly once.
 *
 * Drive, Resonance and Gain are engine constants (0.13, 1.0, 1.0), not
 * exposed parameters. Each trigger restarts the oscillator phase, the
 * envelopes and the filters; the noise generator free-runs.
 *
 * The three engines share the parts of the per-sample chain that are
 * identical: the oscillator, the triangle, the transient burst, the body
 * mix and the output stage live in the shared helpers below. What stays
 * engine-specific is the branch structure each voice actually uses.
