/*
 * h5_noise.c - 32-bit LCG noise with a 48 kHz-target sample-and-hold.
 *
 * Exact reproduction of the documented noise primitive:
 *
 *     X[n+1] = (1103515245 * X[n] + 12345) mod 2^32
 *     u[n]   = X[n] / 2^31                          signed, [-1, 1)
 *     D      = max(1, sample_rate / 48000)          integer division
 *
 * The LCG advances once per output sample; the value is sampled only when
 * the hold phase is zero, matching the reference downSample/sAndH pair. D is
 * the integer division sample_rate / 48000, so the held rate is
 * sample_rate / D: exactly 48 kHz only when the render rate is an integer
 * multiple of 48 kHz (48 kHz, 96 kHz, ...). At 44.1 kHz D is 1 and the held
 * rate is 44.1 kHz; at 88.2 kHz D is 1 as well (the quotient truncates),
 * not 48 kHz. Noise time is voice-local (it advances while the voice is
 * processed); the alternatives are a Phase 3 decision.
 *
 * Every voice owns its own LCG state so the five noise streams stay
 * uncorrelated; each default seed is distinct and non-zero.
