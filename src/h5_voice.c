/*
 * h5_voice.c - per-voice lifecycle and dispatch.
 *
 * Each public voice maps to one of the three engine types. The Tom engine is
 * instantiated three times, so the Tom voices keep independent state.
 *
 * The voice-to-engine map lives in one table: every voice names the engine
 * operation set it runs and where its engine state sits inside the context.
 * The dispatch functions are then a table lookup and an indirect call, and
 * the engine's activity flag is at a fixed offset in every engine state, so
 * the render loop learns that a voice has finished without a second
 * dispatch.
